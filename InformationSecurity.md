# 1. Preamble
## 1.1 Introduction

Januus commits to information security principles through the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability and the promotion of accountability. 

- Confidentiality— Only individuals with authorization can & should access data and information assets
- Integrity— Data should be intact, accurate and complete, and IT systems must be kept operational
- Availability— Users should be able to access information or systems when needed


This policy governs the company’s Information Security Management System (ISMS).

On the basis of risk, the ISMS defines, manages and improves appropriate processes and controls. This policy sets out the company’s responsibilities, accountability and approach and is endorsed by the board of directors.

## 1.2 Scope and goals

This policy applies to all Januus’s information and information systems, globally, whether technical or non-technical, and to all people using these under the company’s authorisation.

The ISMS aims to:

- Take a risk based approach to information & cyber security
- Achieve and demonstrate compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and contractual obligations;
- Promote and evidence due care and due diligence in matters of information security;
- Earn and inspire stakeholder confidence;
- Protect critical information assets;
- Manage information security effectively and appropriately to the risk;
- Ensure appropriate, effective and timely response to security incidents;
- Reduce costs related to security incidents;
- Ensure business continuity;
- Promote information security concerns in all services and projects; and
- On a continual basis, promote the review and improvement of the ISMS.

# 2. Policy

## 2.1 Principles
- Januus will establish, maintain and improve an ISMS and associated risk management programme.
- This policy will be approved by senior management and reviewed at least annually.
- All relevant legislative, regulatory and contractual requirements will be met.
- Deviations from this policy will be identified and remedied.

## 2.2 Requirements
Januus shall:

1. Decide, document and communicate the objectives of the ISMS;
2. Communicate the contents of and responsibilities outlined in this policy to all interested parties;
3. Establish and maintain risk criteria and analyses and take these into account when planning and implementing information security initiatives;
4. Develop such additional policies, documents and controls as are appropriate and proportionate to ensure the efficient operation of the ISMS.
5. Design, implement, change and manage information systems so as to achieve this policy’s objectives.
6. Develop, maintain and regularly test business continuity plans;
7. Measure and monitor compliance with this policy and take steps to maintain and enforce compliance and to improve the ISMS; and
8. Comply with all relevant legislative, regulatory and contractual information security requirements.

## 2.3 Authority and access control
### Management
- Department heads should decide what data can be shared and with whom.
- Sharing of data between departments should be approved by the executive office.
- Employees should get approval from their manager before sharing any confidential data.

### Network access
- Users should only be able to access company networks and servers via unique logins that demand authentication, including passwords, biometrics, ID cards, or tokens. 
- All systems should be monitored and login attempts recorded.

## 2.4 Data classification

The data can have different values. Value index graduations may impose separation and specific handling regimes/procedures for each type. Data can be classified as follows:

- High-Risk Class – Data protected by state and federal laws (Data Protection Law, HIPAA, PCI) as well as finance, payroll, and staff (privacy requirements).
- Confidential Class – Data in this class does not enjoy the privilege of being under the law, but the data holder believes that they must be protected against unauthorized disclosure
- Public Class – This information may be distributed freely.

Data owners should determine both the data classification and the exact measures that a data custodian needs to take to preserve the integrity according to this level.

## 2.5 Support and Data Operations

### Data Backup
All production data should be backed up in two different offsite locations periodically.
These backups should be verified and restore strategies tested regularly.

### Data movement
Any bulk data movement should be approved by Managers
All data in transit should be encrypted securely and keys should be transferred separately.

## 2.6 Security awareness

Sharing IT security policies with the team is a critical step. Making them read and sign a document does not necessarily mean they are familiar with or understand the new policies. 
Regular training sessions should be mandatory for every employee.
- A training session would involve employees in a positive attitude towards information security, which would ensure that they had a sense of the procedures and mechanisms in place to protect data, confidentiality levels, and data sensitivity issues. 
- This awareness training should address a wide range of vital topics: how to collect /use/delete data, maintain data quality, record management, confidentiality, privacy, proper use of IT systems, correct use of social networks, etc.
